Running the workflow:
=====================
Login into github and goto Goto https://github.com/adedner/dune-testpypi
Open the Actions tab and on the left choose 'testing scenarios'.
On the right click 'Run workflow' which open a window with some fields to
fill out. Select the 'feature/cmake-python-overhaul' branch instead of
'main'. The other fields are then already filled out to select the
corresponding branch in core and fem modules. Simply click 'Run workflow'
to start the process.

Folder structure:
=================
Every file ending '.sh' in the 'testing' folder will be run in the following environment:
- every test script is executed in an empty folder (test)
- below this folder there are two folders
  - dist: containing the python package tar gz files from the requestes
    tag/branch of all core modules and dune-fem modules
    (see completeInstall.sh to see how to install from those files)
  - repos: contains all core and fem dune source modules unconfigured
    (see completeSourceNoEnv.sh / completeSourceInEnv.sh for usage)
- Each test script is called with two arguments: the branch/tag name of the
  core and the fem modules, respectively. These are the two arguments that
  can be set when starting the workflow.



Existing Tests
==============

completeInstall.sh
-------------------
First install dune.grid in a venv and run example script then add dune.fem to that
and run a script from the fem tutorial.

completeSourceInEnv.sh
----------------------
Setup a venv and configure all dune source modules, then run a script from
the fem tutorial.

completeSourceNoEnv.sh
----------------------
Configure all dune source modules without an active venv, then run a script from
the fem tutorial using the packages from the dune internal venv.

installPlusSource.sh
--------------------
Setup a venv and install dune.grid. Then configure dune-fem from source and
test a tutorial example. Then install dune.alugrid a reconfigure dune and
run a tutorial example using dune.algurid. Finally, build dune-alugrid from
source and run example.
